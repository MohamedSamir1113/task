This project is a responsive image gallery built with React.js. The gallery displays images using a grid layout and provides a lightbox feature for viewing images in full size. Users can navigate between images using next/previous buttons or keyboard arrow keys, and the gallery supports lazy loading and smooth animations.

Features
Responsive CSS Grid: The gallery uses CSS Grid for a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
Lightbox: A lightbox opens when an image is clicked, allowing users to view images in a modal window.
Keyboard Navigation: Users can navigate between images using the left and right arrow keys.
Lazy Loading: Images are loaded lazily to improve performance, especially with large galleries.
RTL Support: The project has built-in support for right-to-left layouts.

Technologies Used
React.js: Frontend JavaScript framework for building the user interface.
SCSS: Preprocessor for more efficient and modular CSS styling.
React Modal: A modal library for handling the lightbox feature.
CSS Grid: For the responsive layout of the gallery.
JavaScript ES6+: Modern JavaScript for functional components and hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect).
